    "There are a few measures that characterize a data types, like to store the surname of person in one of the column of a table, it will use the string data type, for instance 'James' is a string, a length is a measure used to indicate how many symbols a certain string has, so the 'James' has a length of 5 symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "Digits, symbols, or blank spaces can also be used in the string format, it is very important to note one thing though, no mathematical operations will be executable within a string, they will only convey text information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another characteristic need to understand is size, it indicates the memory space used by a data type and is measured in bytes, it can think of a byte as the approximate space 1 symbol will require from the memory, so in the instances, the 'James' have 5 symbols, and the size of 5 bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally consider storage as the physical space in the computer drive's memory, where the data is being saved or stored."
