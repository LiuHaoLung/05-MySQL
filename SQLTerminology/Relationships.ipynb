    "Relationships, tell you how much of the data from a foreign key field can be seen in the primary key column of the table the data is related to and vice verse.\n",

    "#### One-to-many type of relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "The Customer_id as a primary key of the Customers, this means it contains only unique values 1,2,3 and 4, the same information about Customer_id can be found in the sales table as a foreign key, but you will likely have a lot more than 4 rows there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence the values from 1 to 4 can be repeated many time becuase the same customer could execute more than one purchase, this is an example of a one-to-many type of relationship, one value from the Customer_id column under the Customers table can be found many times in the customer_id in the Sales table.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the relational schema this is shown by assigning the correct symbols at the end of the arrow, you should always read the symbols according to the direction of the relationship you are exploring, for instance think of it this way, a single customer could have made one purchase but could have made more than one purchase to, therefore the second symbol which is next to the rectangle shows the minimum number of instances of the Customers entity that can be associated with the Sales entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "When this symbol is a tiny line, it means 1, the symbol located next to the rectangle indicates the maximum number of instances that can be associated with the Sales entity, the angle like symbol stands for many.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a single purchase registered in the Sales table, a single customer can be indicated as the buyer, so the minimum number of customers you will find in the Customers table for whom we have such information is name, email and number of complaints and that corresponds to a single purchase in the Sales table is one.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, we just said that for a given purchase we can not have more than 1 buyer, meaning that the maximum number of instances from Sales associated with customer is also one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore for every purchase we can obtain the name, email and number of complaints data for one customer and we represent this logic by drawing a line for the minimum and a line for the maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two symbols in closer proximity to the rectangles formed the relationship between the Customers and Sales table according to the specified direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, it is correct to say that the Customers to Sales relationship is one to many, while Sales to Customers is many to one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The symbol showing us relationship limitations are called cardinality constraints, there are other symbols that can be used too <code>| > M N O</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>M or N</code> for infinite associations or <code>O</code> for optional instances which would have been the case if it wasn't necessary for a registered person to have purchased an item.\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some other types of relationships as well, one-to-many, many-to-one, one-to-one, many-to-many and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "To sum up, relational or database schema don't just represent the concept database administrators must implement, they depict how a database is organized, they can be thought of as blueprints or a plan for a database because they are usually prepared at the stage of database design, drawing a relational schema isn't an easy job but relational schemas will help you immensely while writing your queries, a neat and complete visualization of the structure of the entire database will always be useful when retrieving information."
